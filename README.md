2. 🔤 Input the code you generated from the first link into the input field in the app.

3. 🎯 Press the **"Fetch Bingo Card"** button to retrieve your Bingo card.

4. 🔄 Then go back and forth to the GameBoard to roll a number.  
   (Use the same GameCode from step 1 to view the current game state.)

6. 🏆 If you get 5 numbers lined up either vertically or horizontally, press the **"Check if Winning Card"** button to check if you won.

7. 🎉 Enjoy the game!
